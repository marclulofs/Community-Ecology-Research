##### Palaeotemperatures dataset reconstruction ######
######################################################

This is for your information (I do not expect you to read the articles !)

The dataset comes from Condamine et al. 2018 (in prep.)

Basically, the dataset was first assembled for isotopic ratios measurements (delta18 oxygen). This isotopes are naturally precipitated in the carbonated shells of marine organisms. The intensity of this process is dependent upon temperature (among other things), so you can reconstruct ancient sea temperatures using the fossilized shells of this organisms.

The 18O dataset was compiled from Zachos et al. 2008, Prokoph et al. 2011, Cramer et al. 2011.
Temperatures were then derived following the formula in the abstract of Epstein 1953.
